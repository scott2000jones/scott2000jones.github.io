# My Personal Website

This is my personal website. It is built using Hugo and hosted with GitHub pages. All source code is contained in `src/`, and the site can be built by running `hugo` from within this directory - the built site is moved into the root directory ready for hosting.

The site's theme is based on the Avicenna theme (https://github.com/hadisinaee/avicenna) but with some modification.
